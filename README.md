## How Does It Work

Once you set a post as repeating and publish it an exact copy of that post is made and scheduled for publishing a week after the publish date of the original post. Once that repeat post is published it is again copied and set to publish the week after that. This continues until the heat death of the universe, or until you remove the plugin, whichever comes first.
